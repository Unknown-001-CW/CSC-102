    <h1>Welcome to my week 2 Javascript basic page</h1>

    <!-- subheadings for the 4 foundations of programming -->
     <h2>Variables</h2>

     <!-- Our JavaScript code goes in between opening and closing script tags -->
     <script>
        // single line JavaScript comment

        /* multi-line JavaScript comment */

        // Let's create a variable with a default value
        // var means that you want to create a variable
        var firstname = 'Unknown';
        var lastname = '001';
     </script>

     <h2>Functions</h2>

     <script>
        // Let's create a function
        // functions allow you toreuse code
        // Functions are awesome; use them as much as possible
        // to create a function use the JavaScript keyword function
        // then come up with a descriptive function name
        // there will be () 
        // the function code lives in between {}
        function runCalc(){
            // create 2 variables to hold numbers that the user gives me
            var num1 = 0;
            var num2 = 0;

            // let's gather a number from the user
            do{
                num1 = prompt("please enter number 1: ");
                console.log("num1 = " + num1);
            }while(isNaN(num1)); // isNaN - is not a number - if the variable passed in (num1) is not a number, it will return true
            // and the loop will keep running

            console.log("num1 = " + num1);
            
            

            // because JavaScript is loosely/dynamically typed, cast the inputs as numbers
            var sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);
            alert("the sum is: " + sum);

            // return the sum of num1 + num2
            return sum;
        }

        // this code calls the function that we wrote
        var theSum = runCalc();

     </script>

     <h2>Decision Logic</h2>

     <script>
        // create a variable so we can test the value
        var age = 7; // single = is assignment
        // the value on the left side of the = becomes the same as on the right

        // boolean holds true or false
        var hasDriversPermit = true;

        // test the age and display a message depending on the age
        if (age == 5){ // double == is to check equality - are the value the same
            console.log("age is 5");
        }
        else{ // catch - all - if the if statement is not true, the else code will run
            console.log("age is not 5");
        }

        // check multiple conditions
        if (age == 6){ // you can only have 1 if statement in a block of decision logic
            console.log("age is 6");
        }
        else if(age == 12){ // I can have many else if statements
            console.log("age is 12");
        }
        else if(age == 14){
            console.log("age is 14");
        } // if age is 15 or 16, this would be true
        else if(age == 15 || age == 16){ // || is or
            console.log("age is 15 or 16");
        } // if age is 15 and 16, this would be true
        else if((age == 15) && (hasDriversPermit)){ // && is and
            console.log("they can drive with an adult");
        }
        else{ // catch all - if none of the previous conditions were true, run this code
            console.log("some other age");
        }


     </script>

     <h2>Loops</h2>
     <script>
        // loops run code repeatedly
        // loops are great for displaying data
        // there are 2 categories of loops in JavaScript
        // for loop
        // generally, when you (the code) know how many times the loop should run, use a for loop

        // use the for keyword to set up a for loop
        // 1st (var 1 = 0): initialize the counter variable - i is very common in for loops
        // 2nd (i < 5): the condition, that while true, will keep the loop running
        // 3rd (i++): incrementing the counter variable - i++ is the same as i = i + 1
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
            console.log("for loop i=" + i);
        }

        // same example, just changed the variable name from i to counter
        for (var counter = 0; counter < 5; counter++){
            console.log("for loop counter variable=" + counter);
        }

        // while loop
        // generally, when you (the code) don't know how many times the loop should run

        // set up a counter variable for our while loop
        var count = 0;

        // syntax for the while loop is the keyword while
        // the condition, that while true, will keep the loop running
        // a while loop can run 0 time to infinite times
        while (count < 5){
            console.log("while loop count variable=" + count);
            // infinite loops are bad
            // when working with a while loop, always create the off-ramp first
            count++;
        }

        // the do while loop runs between 1 and infinate times
        count = 0;

        // do while loops are great with user input
        do{
            console.log("do while loop count variable=" + count);
            // set up the off ramp
            count++;
        }while(count < 5); // make sure there is a ; at the end of the do while loop condition
